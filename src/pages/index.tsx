        <h1>Hello! Iâ€™m a staff frontend engineer based in Ottawa.</h1>
        <p>
          With a career spanning over a decade, I have established a reputation
          as an architect of high quality user interfaces and seamless web,
          mobile, and native applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have significant experience building high quality prototypes, using
          new technologies and frameworks on the fly, and participating
          effectively in multi-disciplinary teams. This has allowed me to
          contribute to projects for clients ranging from small startups to
          large corporations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a passionate problem-solver. I enjoy hearing about big, new ideas
          and figuring out how to make them happen. Interested in hearing more?
          Please get in touch!
